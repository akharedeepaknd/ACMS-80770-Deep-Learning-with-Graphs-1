An Evaluation of Spectral Algorithm with Additive Clustering for Detecting Overlapping Communities in Psychological Networks
======================================

In this project, we aim to explore the potential of the spectral algorithm with additive clustering (SAAC) in detecting overlapping communities in psychological networks. We also compared its performance with another available technique, OCCAM (Overlapping Continuous Community Assignment Model spectral algorithm, through a simulation study. Finally, We included three real data examples to further illustrate the use of overlapping clustering methods in psychological networks.

## Getting Started

Install R and Rstudio

### Dependencies

This implementation requires:

 * Gmedian
 * ClusterR
 * MPsychoR
 * qgraph
 * foreign
 * GGMselect
 * gtools
 * perturbR


### Installation

After downloading the code, you may install each package by running

``` in R
install.packages("package name")
```

### Data

Data samples are generated through `test.R`. Run each line one by one in RStudio.


## Realdata examples

Realdata example results are shown in `realdata.R`. Run each line one by one in RStudio.
